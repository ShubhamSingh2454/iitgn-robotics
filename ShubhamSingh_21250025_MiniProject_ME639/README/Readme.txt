Task_0: Completed

Task_1: Completed, Simulation running with visualisation.
-End Effector of the 2R manipulator able to follow the trajectory and reach the wall which is within its workspace.
-The effect of slow speed trajectory following and fast speed trajectory following is observed. In the slow mode the end effector was following the trajectory more precisely and was able to reach the wall as desired(Readme_Figure-2).
-In the fast mode, the end effector skipped some points of the trajectory and it went beyond the wall(Readme_Figure-3).

Task_2: Completed, Simulation Running without Force visualisation.
-Tried incorporating the force control in the Code of Task_1. The code is running and applying force on the wall, but not able to visualise the force which is exerted by the end effector on the wall.

Task_3: Completed, Simulation Running with visualisation, but not behaving like a virtual spring.
-For understanding the concept, took help from the control scheme of double inverted pendulum.

Task_4: Completed, Simulation running with Visualisation.
-The code is running perfectly and is able to plot and visualise the workspace (Readme_Figure-1) for the angles given in the problem statement.
